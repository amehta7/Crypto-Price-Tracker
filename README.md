# Crypto Price Tracker

The Crypto Price Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to track the prices of popular cryptocurrencies in real-time. Users can search for specific cryptocurrencies, view their latest prices, and view historical price charts for each selected cryptocurrency.

This application is built using **React**, **React Query**, and **Chart.js** for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Features

- Search for popular cryptocurrencies.
- Display real-time price data for each cryptocurrency.
- View historical price charts for each selected cryptocurrency.
- Fetch data from the **CoinCap API**.
